# Trip to France in Retrospect

## Introduction

Since I was a little boy I've always wanted to travel the world. But since my health wasn't very good and we didn't have much money to spare I never traveled outside of my home country.

Now after all of those years I've finally found the time, energy and money to travel abroad. Actually I wasn't planning to travel to France but my girlfriend came up with the idea so I just joined her.

I'm not a very touristy person. I don't care about big cities, monuments, shopping malls, etc. I care about small villages, local people and nature. But since it was my girlfriends trip I said why not give it a try.

## Day 0

### Airport

I hate public transportation. Too many people, too much stress and too much information. I get overstimulated very easily so crowded places don't make me feel very comfortable.

Either way we took a train from Pilsen to Prague, then metro to Zličín and a bus from there to the airport.

Since we've checked in online and had only hand luggage it was very easy and relatively stress-free (for a person with experience, who I wasn't so for me it was still pretty stressfull) to get to the onboarding area.

It was my first time flying and I've really enjoyed the body sensations when we were taking off and taking down. I've really enjoyed the clouds. They looked like mountains from a fantasy book or like an infinite ocean of bubbles.

I kept looking out of the window the whole time.

### Public transportation

Once we've arrived in Paris we had to somehow get to our Airbnb. This was my first introduction to the Paris public transportation. There was a booth looking thing standing outside where you could buy a ticket which was pretty straightforward for me but not so much for my girlfriend. -1 UX point.

After we bought the tickets we were quite perplexed since there were blank spaces for name, surname and the date during which the ticket is valid. Like any other person in 2023 we didn't have a pen on us so we left it blank and just took the bus. -1 UX point.

### Airbnb

We somehow managed to get to our destination which was Courbevoie. We thought that we've rented the whole apartment and that we're gonna be there alone but nope. After we've met our host we've learnt that we're gonna be staying in his room and he's gonna be sleeping on the couch in the living room which was right in front of our room.

Because of that we've had a lot of empty, slicent and awkward encounters with the host whenever we wanted to leave our room because he'd always be sitting there on the couch. It made me feel very frustrated but what could have I done? Nothing. So I just accepted it.

## Day 1 & 2

For me these two days are kind of blurry since I wasn't really having a good time. 

My girlfriend was supposed to go back to her home country in no less than a month and we've agreed that we're gonna end our relationship once she leaves since having a long distance relationship would be impossible.

I wanted to hide my true feelings from my girlfriend and me so bad but they were stronger. As a consequence of that none of us were really having fun. I was tense and sad all the time and my girlfriend was feeling sad because of that too.

For me the highlight of these 3 days was when she wanted to go somewhere where I didn't want to go so I could go explore the city with a camera in my hand alone. I took a few ok-ish photos and managed to get drunk since I've mistakenly ordered twice as much wine as I wanted.

The tension was building up and my heart was hurting more and more with each day.

## Day 3

During this day I felt like I was really forcing myself to smile. During the evening when we were lying in a bed I couldn't pretend anymore.

In the last couple of months that we've been together I've felt a lot of real and genuine joy while being with her. She is such a beautiful, kind and curious person. She inspires me a lot. I couldn't just let her go and get over it. It seemed utterly impossible for me.

So as I was mindlessly scrolling on Instagram in the last attempts to hide my emotions she asked me if I'm ok. I told her my true feelings. I'm usually not a guy who cries. I cry maybe once a year. And this was the day. That night I cried like I haven't cried in a very long time.

I fell asleep with a smile on my face though. We've agreed that we're at least gonna try to continue in the relationship. Her telling me this made me cry like a little boy. But I was happy. I haven't been this happy in a long time.

## Day 4

We had to leave our Airbnb early in the morning. Our next place was a couchsurfing place hosted by a huy called Alain. More about him later. 

Alain couldn't meet us at the time we've previously agreed on so we had to change our plans.

After a while of trying to find a good croissant we've settled in a small coffee shop. She had a scheduled call during which I was sitting there and getting more and more bored. Also my social anxiety kicked in and the waitress forgot about my order. All of this and more made me lose a lot of my mental energy.

I knew we weren't really having fun so in the evening we had another serious talk. This time I didn't cry but I did sweat a lot since it was very uncomfortable. We both agreed that we feel guilty for the other one not enjoying the trip. We figured out ways to communicate emotions more effectively and found our triggers.

I fell asleep with a smile on my face again. After every difficult talk there is a lot of relief and joy. I just hope from now on we're gonna have more easy and joyfull talks rather than difficult ones. But it's true that one can find a lot they didn't know before about the other one during these talks. So in the end I'm really grateful for any talk.

## Day 5

For me the trip really started this day. All the previously mentioned emotional baggage has disappeared and we could finally enjoy the trip. I felt great and I could feel that she also felt better which made me feel warm in my heart.

Alain, our host, took us on a little tour in his neighborhood and it was so very lovely. I didn't know an average looking place could be this interesting and hide so many little treasures.

When we came back from the tour Alain made us Crepe with cheese and a salad which really made my day. I atribute a lot of my good feelings I've felt during the stay in his place to him. He was such a wonderful host and truly interesting a nd lovely person. If I had more time I'd like to get to know him better. Maybe I just saw a father figure in him which I never had.

After that we saw an intercultural market with a bunch of weird food and people speaking languages I've never heard. We went to a very nice book store and saw a little live concert in a park nearby.

We had plenty of fun on electric scooters. I really recommend to everyone to ride in two people on a single scooter. I still smile when I remember that.

In the evening the dark clouds finally caught us and it started raining very heavily. We waited some time and then went into a coffee shop and then back to Alains place.

## Day 6

We took a photo with Alain and said our final goodbyes and thankyous and went outside to experience the horrors of public transportation again. Our next stop was Lyon. Alains birthplace as we've learnt during our stay with him.

We had fun with scooters again and saw Notre Dame. The father was very lovely but more importantly he spoke chinese which really surprised us. I love the serenity of the place. I left Notre Dame very calm.
