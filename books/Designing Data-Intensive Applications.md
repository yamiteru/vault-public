# Designing Data-Intensive Applications

## Chapter 1

Many applications today are data-intensive, as opposed to compute-intensive. Raw CPU power is rarely a limiting factor for these applications—bigger problems are usually the amount of data, the complexity of data, and the speed at which it is changing.

### Reliability

The system should continue to work correctly (performing the correct function at the desired level of performance) even in the face of adversity (hardware or soft‐
ware faults, and even human error). 

### Scalability

As the system grows (in data volume, traffic volume, or complexity), there should be reasonable ways of dealing with that growth. 

### Maintainability

Over time, many different people will work on the system (engineering and operations, both maintaining current behavior and adapting the system to new use cases), and they should all be able to work on it productively.

## Chapter 2

Data models are perhaps the most important part of developing software, because they have such a profound effect: not only on how the software is written, but also on how we think about the problem that we are solving.

Applications inevitably change over time.

In most cases, a change to an application’s features also requires a change to data that it stores
