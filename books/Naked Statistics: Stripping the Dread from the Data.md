The problem is that if the data are poor, or if the statistical techniques are used improperly, the conclusions can be wildly misleading and even potentially dangerous.

“People Who Take Short Breaks at Work Are Far More Likely to Die of Cancer” - most likely it's because they smoke during that short break.

Statistics is like a high-caliber weapon: helpful when used correctly and potentially disastrous in the wrong hands.

Statistics rarely offers a single “right” way of doing anything.

An overreliance on any descriptive statistic can lead to misleading conclusions, or cause undesirable behavior.

Probability is one weapon in an arsenal that requires good judgment.

Regression analysis is the tool that enables researchers to isolate a relationship between two variables, such as smoking and cancer, while holding constant (or “controlling for”) the effects of other important variables, such as diet, exercise, weight, and so on.

Smart and honest people will often disagree about what the data are trying to tell us.

So, to return to the title chapter, what is the point of learning statistics?

- To summarize huge quantities of data
- To make better decisions
- To answer important social questions
- To recognize patterns that can refine how we do everything from selling diapers to catching criminals
- To catch cheaters and prosecute criminals
- To evaluate the effectiveness of policies, programs, drugs, medical procedures, and other innovations
- And to spot the scoundrels who use these very same powerful tools for nefarious ends

The normal distribution. Data that are distributed normally are symmetrical around their mean in a bell shape that will look familiar to you.

Any index is highly sensitive to the descriptive statistics that are cobbled together to build it, and to the weight given to each of those components. As a result, indices range from useful but imperfect tools to complete charades.

Although the field of statistics is rooted in mathematics, and mathematics is exact, the use of statistics to describe complex phenomena is not exact.

Correlation does not imply causation.

The probability of Event A happening and Event B happening is the probability of Event A multiplied by the probability of Event B.

You should always insure yourself against any adverse contingency that you cannot comfortably afford to withstand. You should skip buying insurance on everything else.
