A broad term meaning that a program is 1) event-based, 2) acts in response to input, and 3) is viewed as a flow of data, instead of the traditional flow of control. It doesn’t dictate any specific method of achieving these aims. Reactive programming gives looser coupling between program components, so the code is more modular.
