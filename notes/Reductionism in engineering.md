The reductionist approach to engineering has four steps:
1.  Start with a complex problem.
2.  Break the problem into simpler parts.
3.  Solve the parts.
4.  Compose the parts of the solution into a whole.

Reductionalism has a hidden assumption of [[Compositionality]]: that the nature of the parts doesn’t change when we compose them.
