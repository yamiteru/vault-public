# Bio

Hey! I'm a 💻 developer who's crazy about reactive/event-driven programming, functional programming and performance. I mainly program in TypeScript and I currently work as a senior dev and tech lead. I'm really into philosophy and spirituality. We're all students 👨‍🎓 becoming better every day.

# Schedule

I'm extremely inconsistent with streaming schedule. Sometimes I stream every other day and sometimes I stream once a month.

I recommend joining our Discord channel or following me on Twitter to know when and what I'm going to stream ahead of time.

# Donations

I'm honestly much more grateful for an honest feedback than for the money. 

So if you want to make my day then just send me a feedback in the chat for free.

All of the donations are gonna be used for a better streaming equipment.

# Can I hire you?

If you like the way I think and work then yes you can hire me.

Here's a little list of things I can help you with:
- Consultation
- Education plan
- Mock interview
- Pair programming
- Code review

All of the items above will be for half of what I usually charge since I'll stream/record them and use them for content and I'll use all of the money for a better streaming equipment.

I can also develop a whole library/service/app for you but streaming/recording that will depend on your preferences and project detail.

If you're interested then let me know on [yamiteru@icloud.com](mailto:yamiteru@icloud.com).

# About me

I'm an existential nihilist who wants to understand the world he lives in.

Originally I was a very passionate designer and programming was just my hobby. Since developers are paid much more than designers I've become a developer. 

I'd love to get back to design though. I really miss it.

When it comes to development I really enjoy the fact that I can come up with any idea and manifest it. 

I also like to view development through the lens of ecology which is probably why I'm so crazy about performance (faster = consumes less energy = better for the planet).

One of my biggest dreams is to travel the whole world as a digital nomad. Freedom in all its shapes and forms is very important to me. 

I also want to become a better person so seeing all the different people and their different opinions and mindsets from all around the world is a big motivation.

If you wanna know more then hit the follow button and come say hi when I'm online.

# About stream

I've been streaming programming for the last ±18 months.

But only recently I've switched from speaking Czech (which is my primary language) to English which I'm not very used to speaking so I've warned you!

You can type !commands into the chat to see the list of all commands. But here is a little list of a few of them:
- !pc - My PC
- !os - Operating system
- !editor - My editor/s
- !theme - Editor theme
- !project - The current project I'm working on

Here is a list of rules:
- Don't be offensive towards me or other people 
- Don't ask me questions that you can easily Google
- If you ask a question then provide information about what you've already tried, what errors you're getting and what is the desired outcome
- Don't ask questions about other projects while I'm working on a different one
- Don't create X vs Y wars

# Projects

## Snail
Have you ever felt overstimulated by the amount of information we nowadays have at our disposal? Do you feel like you have to respond immediately once someone messages you or do you feel bad leaving someone on seen?

We use instant messaging on daily basis. I like to call this fast communication. It leads to addiction, depression, anxiety, etc.

Currently there is no real slow alternative. Snail is supposed to be that alternative. It let's you send 1 "letter" per person per day. Additionally you get all your letters once a day (most likely in the morning).

It basically simulates a physical post office to some extend.

All of the projects can be found [here](https://github.com/yamiteru/vault-public/tree/master/projects).
