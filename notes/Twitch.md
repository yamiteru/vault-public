## Snail

Have you ever felt overstimulated by the amount of information we nowadays have at our disposal? Do you feel like you have to respond immediately once someone messages you or do you feel bad leaving someone on seen?

We use instant messaging on daily basis. I like to call this fast communication. It leads to addiction, depression, anxiety, etc.

Currently there is no real slow alternative. Snail is supposed to be that alternative. It let's you send 1 "letter" per person per day. Additionally you get all your letters once a day (most likely in the morning).

It basically simulates a physical post office to some extend.

We need to first finish these 3 dependencies:
- Data validation
- Event emitter
- Binary en/decoder

## Vaal

Runtime data validation TS library. The main goals are performance and size. It's a dependency of Reval.

## Î¼Eve
