John von Neumann described it in 1945.

It’s the basis for the modern computer: the processor reads the program instructions from memory and executes them, giving rise to the manipulation of data in memory. 

The memory and processor are separate entities, connected by a bus.

Today’s machines are based on an architecture called non-uniform memory access (NUMA). They also use cache which does not exist in the original von Neumann machine.

There are many ways to build a computer. For example:
- Single processors with local memory connected by fast Ethernet
- Massively parallel array processors, such as graphics processing units (GPUs)
- Field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), where memory and code are near each other
- Optical computers
- Quantum computers
