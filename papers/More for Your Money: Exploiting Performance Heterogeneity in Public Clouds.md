# TLDR;

Placement gaming = customer-controlled strategies for selecting instances in order to exploit performance heterogeneity in cloud computing environments. The paper aims to show how customers can optimize their resource usage and improve efficiency by strategically placing their workloads on better-performing instances within a cloud provider's infrastructure.

These strategies include up-front exploration (initially launching more instances than needed and retaining only high-performers) and opportunistic replacement (migrating an instance based on projections of future performance).

Not all VM instances are created equal: distinct underlying hardware differences, contention, and other phenomena can result in vastly differing performance across supposedly equivalent instances. The result is striking variability in the resources received for the same price.

Cloud computing providers use a simple billing model in which customers pay a flat hourly fee for a bundle of virtualized resources.

However, not all instances of a given type are created equal. Data centers grow to contain multiple generations of hardware (e.g., network switches, disks, and CPU architectures) as old components are replaced or new capacity is added. Network topology may vary, with some routes having lower latency or supporting higher bandwidth than others. Multiplexing systems across customers with differ- ent workloads can also lead to uneven resource contention across the cloud.

A customer that runs the same application on two instances, of the same abstract type, will often end up paying the same amount for measurably different performance.

Variation can be large, with performance varying by more than a factor of three across different instances.

The first is up-front exploration, in which a customer initially launches more instances than needed and retains only ones predicted to be high-performers. 

The second mechanism is opportunistic replacement, in which a customer can choose to migrate an instance (by shutting it down and launching a fresh copy) based on projections of future performance for the instance.

The goals of our study are to quantify three types of heterogeneity:

1. Inter-architecture: differences due to processor architecture or system configuration.
2. Intra-architecture: differences within a processor architecture or system configuration.
3. Temporal: differences within a single machine over time.

A major source of heterogeneity in cloud environments is physically different processor architectures.

There is also substantial variation across systems with the same architecture. This can arise from different system- level components, such as memory and peripherals, and from long-term interference from other workloads on the same node. In our experiments, we found such intra-architecture variation to be quite common.

The variation of individual nodes over time indicates that workloads may prefer nodes with more stable performance and benefit from migrating away from congestion.
