# TLDR;

AWS and Oracle bare-metal HPC instances have lower OS noise compared to non-bare-metal instances. On the other hand, on AWS and Azure, HPC and normal instances experience noise with high intensity and frequency.

On average, the cost of AWS bare-metal and non-bare-metal HPC instances is higher compared to Oracle's bare-metal HPC instances. However, the cost for non-bare-metal HPC instances is similar between AWS and Oracle.
