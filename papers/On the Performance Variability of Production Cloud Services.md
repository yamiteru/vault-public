# TLDR;

cloud services, especially Amazon Web Services and Google App Engine, exhibit yearly and daily performance patterns, periods of stable performance, and high variability in monthly median values. The impact of performance variability varies greatly depending on the type of large-scale application, with some applications being minimally affected while others are significantly impacted.

Cloud providers do not disclose their infrastructure characteristics or how they change, and operate their physical resources in time-sharing; this situation may cause significant performance variability.
