# TLDR;

Bayesian inference can be used for evaluating benchmarks by analyzing the uncertainty and variability in the benchmark results. It offers a flexible framework for estimating the impact of different factors on performance and for understanding interactions between these factors. It also provides explicit assumptions and allows for easier interpretation of the results.

Bayesian inference works by updating our beliefs about the likelihood of different outcomes based on new evidence. It involves starting with prior beliefs about the outcomes, then updating those beliefs with new data to obtain posterior beliefs. This approach allows us to quantify and reason about uncertainty in a systematic way.
