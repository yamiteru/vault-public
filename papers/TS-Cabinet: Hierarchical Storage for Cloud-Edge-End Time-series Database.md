By building a temperature model, we calculate the current temperature for the time-series data, and use the workload forecasting model to predict the data’s future temperature. 

Finally, we perform hierarchical storage according to the data migration policy.

**If the data is accessed frequently, it means its temperature is high.**

We model the temperature based on Newton’s law of cooling and the law of thermal radiation.

Newton’s law of cooling describes an object, when its temperature is higher than the ambient temperature, will discharge Arnie’s heat to the surrounding environment and gradually cool down, and the cooling rate is proportional to the temperature diﬀerence between the object and the ambient temperature.
