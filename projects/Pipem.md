A simple pipe function and pipe utilities with correct TypeScript inference.

Once a person adopts functional mindset pipes can be found virtually anywhere. 

TypeScript has no official pipe operator/function and utilities to go along with it and the current alternatives either have incorrect type inference or are too complex making it hard for an individual or a team to adopt them.

Pipem has a very simple a predictable API. It's encouraged to build other abstractions/libraries on top of it.

### Libraries build on top Pipem:
- [[Vaal]]
- [[Reval]]
