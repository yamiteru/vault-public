A simple and easily extendable data validation library with TypeScript inference and focus on performance built on top of [[Pipem]].

Currently there are slow and overly complex libraries like Zod or fast but very hard to extend libraries like ??.

Vaal uses a small set of core principles making it very easy to extend. And since functional composition is used instead of classes it's very tree-shaking friendly and fast.
