A collection of things around my alter-ego Yamiteru.

Yamiteru is composed of two words. Yami - darkness. Teru - brightness. The idea behind the name is harmony and the natural duality of being. Yin Yang.

# Notes
Honestly right now having just a blog feels wrong. I don't write that often to be able to fill the blog with enough content. It's basically a useless website.

Also I have no branding. Meaning I have no logo, colors or any other visual or sound language.

I should clearly define the target audience/s and their motivation/s and design the website around that.
